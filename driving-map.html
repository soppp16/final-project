               "Lynn Valley Care Centre, in North Vancouver, announced the first COVID-19 death in Canada on 8th March 2020. Since then, this care centre has been an epicentre of increasing confirmed cases and deaths. However, non-profits in North Vancouver continue to support the changing needs of the vulnerable communities. Harvest Project is an organization which provides support to families without income, and in poverty. All in-person programs have been suspended, so the Harvest project has been adjusting their groceries program to function without person-to-person contact. This has been done by providing grocery store gift cards to those that need them. Other societies including Hollyburn Family Services and Capilano Community Services are remaining in contact with seniors and youths via phone calls, and volunteers are providing grocery pick-up services to seniors.

                "In a neighbourhood with already poor living conditions, the DTES is an area with a high susceptibility in relation to COVID-19. There are currently 15,000 people at risk in this area, with 3,000 of these people being homeless, and 4,700 being tenants in high risk Single Room Occupancy hostels (SROâ€™s). This is making it increasingly hard for citizens to social distance in this low income area. The DTES Response has been developed in reaction to the pandemic to prevent further spread. They have mobilized resources and set up funds in support of this vulnerable population. These funds will go towards the Overdose Prevention Society, the DTES SRO Collaborative, the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society and other supporting organizations.",

Also, Alexander Neighbourhood House has produced a phone tree to encourage community support among White Rock residents. Volunteers of the Semiahmoo Peninsula are available to help deliver groceries to seniors or other vulnerable citizens. White Rock City Council is also taking action to prevent further spread by temporarily closing all public and recreational spaces, including White Rock Pier. ',
